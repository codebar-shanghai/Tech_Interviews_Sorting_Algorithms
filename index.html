                        Welcome everyone to the Tech Interviews with Sorting
                        Algorithms Workshop. I’m Lauren Collins, and I’ll be
                        guiding you through today's session. This workshop is
                        designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of how
                        sorting algorithms play a crucial role in technical
                        interviews and to prepare you for real-world coding
                        challenges. Throughout this session, we’ll explore
                        different sorting techniques and practice implementing
                        them. In addition, we’ll also be introduced to
                        techniques for practicing soft skills, such as
                        communication and problem-solving, which are highly
                        valued by employers.

                    You'll learn what interviewers are looking for and how to prepare confidently. 
                    To prepare for this presentation, I interviewed hiring managers. Today, I will share their insights on what they value in candidates.

                        I interviewed hiring managers about the key traits they value at each career level. 
                        Across all levels, they expect candidates to showcase their work publicly. 
                        For junior roles, soft skills are critical. Mid-level candidates should demonstrate adaptability 
                        and growth, while senior professionals are expected to exhibit deep knowledge and thought leadership.

                        David emphasized that communication skills are just as important as technical 
                        ability in interviews. Candidates should clearly explain their thought process 
                        and decisions. He highlighted the value of experiencing both success and failure, 
                        as resilience and learning from mistakes are key traits employers seek. 
                        Self-learning is essential in the fast-changing tech world, and staying 
                        current with coding practices is crucial. David also recommends "learning in public" 
                        by sharing projects on platforms like GitHub, as it showcases initiative and real skills. 
                        Lastly, he noted that a degree isn't necessary—practical skills and a strong portfolio often matter more.

                             Employers value skills like algorithms, data structures, and software methodologies, 
                             which can be learned through self-study. My advisor also highlighted these as key for tech jobs.

                        By now, you should be in groups of two or more. In this session, you’ll practice pair programming and top-down design. 
                        Each activity is structured to help you use industry-relevant terminology and collaborate effectively, 
                        turning abstract algorithms into clear, concrete concepts. 
                        We’ll now open the activities in CodeSpace on your computer for a hands-on experience.

                        In pairs, choose and code an algorithm such as Merge Sort or the RSA Algorithm.

                    <p>
                        Apply what you've learned from Pair Programming, and top-down programming. Focus on clear communication and collaboration as you work through the coding tasks together.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        I want to emphasize the importance of communication during this exercise. Make sure both you and your partner understand each step and can clearly explain your thought process. The goal is not just to code, but to work effectively as a team and improve your collaboration skills.
