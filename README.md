# Tech Interviews with Sorting Algorithms Workshop

Welcome to the **Tech Interviews with Sorting Algorithms** workshop. This repository contains a presentation built with **Reveal.js** to help you prepare for technical interviews, with a special focus on sorting algorithms. The workshop covers a wide range of topics, from coding practices to communication and collaboration in tech interviews.

## Presentation Overview

This workshop aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in technical interviews. By exploring various sorting algorithms, youâ€™ll learn how to analyze algorithmic efficiency and practice implementing these algorithms in code. Additionally, this workshop emphasizes the importance of soft skills, such as communication and problem-solving, which are critical in interviews.

## Workshop Goals:
- Understand key sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **RSA Algorithm**.
- Analyze and explain the time and space complexity of these algorithms.
- Learn best practices for coding interviews, including top-down programming and pair programming techniques.
- Prepare for technical interviews at different experience levels (Junior, Mid-Level, Senior).
- Practice clear communication of technical concepts and problem-solving approaches.

## Repository Contents

- **Codebase:** The repository contains code for various sorting algorithms in multiple languages. You can access the code for practicing sorting algorithms and implementing them as part of the workshop.
